Our goal is to build <i>intelligent water systems</i> that use real-time sensing and control to solve modern water challenges.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2><a href="/research/wireless-sensor-networks">Wireless sensor networks for water infrastructure</a></h2> New technologies are enabling real-time supervision and control of previously static stormwater and flood control infrastructure. We are designing a new generation of cyber-physical systems that incorporate low-power embedded electronics, wireless communications, and web services to transform passive water systems into active ones.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2><a href="/research/estimation-and-control">State estimation and control</a></h2> Like self-driving cars, autonomous water systems will require new algorithms to estimate system dynamics from sensor data and guide system behavior towards desirable states. We are exploring how advances in modern control theory can improve our understanding of water infrastructure and inform better operational resilience.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2><a href="/research/digital-twins">Digital twin models of water infrastructure</a></h2> Water managers are increasingly seeking <i>digital twins</i> of real-world water networks that combine sensor data with online models in order to better understand and control system dynamics. We are building new real-time models that will allow operators to geolocate flooding, detect maintenance emergencies, and better implement dynamic control.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2><a href="/research/coupled-infrastructure-modeling">Coupled infrastructure system modeling</a></h2> Water, energy, and transportation grids are closely linked; yet their coupled dynamics are still poorly understood. We are exploring how critical infrastructure systems interact in a dynamical context, and how coordinated sensing, modeling and control can achieve better resilience of civil systems as a whole.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2>Advancing equity-centered stormwater solutions in Austin, TX</h2> This research project will initiate a first-of-its kind equity-centered green stormwater infrastructure pilot program in the Dove Springs community in East Austin. Our goal is to work with City of Austin (CoA) Watershed Protection Department and Office of Sustainability agency staff; Go Austin, Vamos Austin (GAVA); and other community leaders to co-develop solutions to long-standing urban drainage problems that impact underserved communities in the area.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2>Evaluate improved streamflow measurement techniques at TxDOT bridges</h2> The goal of this project is to develop a real-time operational flood forecasting system for Texas roadways and bridges. This flood forecasting system will use a network of roughly 80 streamflow gages along with streamflow predictions from the National Water Model to anticipate roadway flooding and alert emergency operators.
