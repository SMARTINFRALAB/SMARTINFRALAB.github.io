    <h2><a href="/research/next-generation-wireless-smart-sensor">Next Generation Wireless Smart Sensor</a></h2>
    SITL is advancing a next-generation wireless smart sensor platform engineered for broad industry adoption, paving the way for Big Data-driven, self-aware AI in infrastructure maintenance. The latest model, JANET, integrates a powerful 6-channel strain sensor, a 3-channel accelerometer, and adaptable ports for seamless integration with various sensor types.

<div class="page__rcol"><h2>CAREER: Towards watersheds as water treatment plants through advances in distributed sensing and control</h2> This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research that will explore the potential for real-time control of hydraulic infrastructure to reduce nutrient pollution in river networks. This project will investigate how real-time control of hydraulic infrastructure like dams can treat nutrient pollution by emulating processes from wastewater treatment plants at the watershed scale. This new approach has the potential to substantially reduce nutrient pollution impacts while obviating the need for expensive infrastructure expansion projects. These research efforts will be complemented with an educational plan designed to promote active learning of surface water quality concepts through the development of a new computer simulation game targeted at students of all levels.
