Introduction to control theory for civil engineers, with applications to
structural, hydraulic, transportation, HVAC, electrical, and water/wastewater
treatment systems. Presents mathematical methods for (i) modeling civil
infrastructure systems, (ii) estimating system states from sensor data, and
(iii) controlling system dynamics. Topics include differential equation-based
models of civil infrastructure; time and frequency domain representations;
linear spaces and linear operators; state-space models; modal analysis;
controllability and observability; feedback control; state estimation; and
system identification. Three lecture hours a week for one semester.
Prerequisite: graduate standing; undergraduate-level differential equations and
linear algebra; programming experience with Python or MATLAB recommended.
